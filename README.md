📱 Chrome_door

iPhone-First HTML Sandbox & Local Portal

⸻

Overview

Chrome_door is a lightweight, iPhone-first web utility that allows users to load, inspect, modify, and preview local HTML files inside a sandboxed environment.

It runs entirely in the browser, requires no installation, and is designed to be used via Safari on iPhone, including Add to Home Screen mode.

Chrome_door is a tool, not a platform.

⸻

What Chrome_door Is

Chrome_door functions as:
	•	A local HTML reader
	•	A code inspection surface
	•	A sandboxed preview portal
	•	A manual, session-based execution console

All actions occur only when explicitly initiated by the user.

⸻

How It Works
	1.	The user selects a local HTML file
	2.	The file is displayed in the Code Inspector
	3.	The content is executed in a sandboxed iframe
	4.	The user may:
	•	Edit the code
	•	Preview changes live
	•	Save the modified file back to the device

No state is preserved after reload.

⸻

Platform Focus
	•	Optimized for iPhone Safari
	•	Touch-first interface
	•	Works as a Home Screen web app
	•	No App Store dependency
	•	Desktop browsers are supported but not the primary target

⸻

Content Responsibility

Chrome_door does not filter, analyze, moderate, or restrict content.

All content loaded, viewed, or executed is provided by the user and used at the user’s own responsibility.

The app:
	•	Does not generate content
	•	Does not fetch content automatically
	•	Does not classify or label content
	•	Does not endorse or evaluate content

Chrome_door behaves similarly to a text editor or local file viewer.

⸻

Security Model
	•	All execution occurs inside a sandboxed iframe
	•	No automatic network activity
	•	No cookies, tracking, or analytics
	•	No background processes
	•	No hidden behavior

The host environment remains passive and observable.

⸻

Design Boundaries

Chrome_door operates strictly within a visible, user-controlled session.

It does not attempt to:
	•	Manage identities or accounts
	•	Persist data beyond the session
	•	Automate execution
	•	Operate in the background

These behaviors are intentionally outside the app’s design.
